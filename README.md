## LynchburgJS: Core set of models, controllers and utils

PROJECT STATUS
------------

We are in the process of moving the JS code over to TypeScript. Some internal-caused dependencies will be removed in as this progresses.

Namespaces will be added to avoid conflicts!


INSTALLATION
------------

Check demos/basic for a basic setup.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

jQuery is currently required, but this dependency will probably be removed in the future.
